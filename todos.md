NEED:
- A word (different word each day)


- 6 rows of 5 spaces (probably inputs)
- A submit button
  * after submit, letters will be marked as either yellow red or green


- Mock Keyboard Component
  - After a guess, a key becomes disabled if it is not in the word

- Feedback Component
  - Color chart to share but no letters

- Cypress for testing
